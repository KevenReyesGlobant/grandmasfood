  # Maven Parent Overrides Issue

  ## Description
  The project POM inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent POM, which requires manual overrides to prevent this inheritance.

  ## Expected Behavior
  The project POM should only inherit necessary elements from the parent POM without requiring manual overrides for unwanted elements.

  ## Actual Behavior
  The project POM inherits unwanted elements such as `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent POM, necessitating manual overrides.

  ## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Set up a Maven project with a parent POM.
  2. Observe the inherited elements in the project POM.
  3. Note the presence of unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>`.
