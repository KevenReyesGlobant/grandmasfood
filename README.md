# GRANDMASFOOD

Project developed for the GrandmasFood business.  
This project implements microservices using **Hexagonal Architecture**, which facilitates **scalability**, **maintainability**, and a **clear separation** between the domain, application, and infrastructure layers, ensuring proper communication between **ports** and **adapters**.

Additionally, for integration testing, an in-memory **H2** database is used, allowing the complete behavior of endpoints and services to be validated in an **isolated**, **safe**, and **reproducible** environment.
