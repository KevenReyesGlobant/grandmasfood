  # Maven Parent Overrides Issue

  ## Description
  In a Maven project, unwanted elements such as `<license>` and `<developers>` are inherited from the parent POM. This can cause issues when these elements are not desired in the project POM.

  ## Expected Behavior
  The project POM should not inherit unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent POM.

  ## Actual Behavior
  The project POM inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent POM.

  ## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Use a parent POM in a Maven project.
  2. Observe the inherited elements in the project POM.
  3. Notice the unwanted `<license>` and `<developers>` elements.

  ## File Names
  - `path/to/project/pom.xml`: The project POM file where the unwanted elements are inherited.

  ## Environment Information
  - Maven
  - Spring Boot

  ## Code and Symbols
  ```xml
  <license>
  <developers>
  ```

  This issue requires attention to ensure that only the desired elements are inherited in the project POM.
